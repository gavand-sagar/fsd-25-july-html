    <hr />
    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
    <p>
        <b>Shannen Says</b> is an eight-episode American reality television series
        broadcast on WE TV from April 10 to May 13, 2012. The show focuses
        on the preparations for the wedding of actress Shannen Doherty
        and photographer Kurt Iswarienko, with help from celebrity-wedding
        planner David Tutera. Doherty and Iswarienko developed the show as
        a way to document the stress on a couple while planning their wedding.
    </p>

    <p> <i>Filmed in Malibu,</i> California, between August 2011 and October 2011, Shannen Says was produced by
        RelativityReal and Doherty's production company No Apologies Productions. To prepare for filming, Doherty
        watched
        reality shows by Tori Spelling and Kim Kardashian. The series was released on the iTunes Store and Amazon Video
        under the title Shannen Says, Season 1, but it was not made available on DVD or Blu-ray.</p>

    <p> <i><b>Shannen Says had</b></i> low viewership and ranked below most other programs when it premiered, but had
        some
        popularity among women between the ages of 25 and 54. Doherty said it was intended as a one-off, with no plans
        for a
        second season. Shannen Says and Doherty received mixed reviews.</p>
